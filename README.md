*Not a to-do list. A relationship. Your cat companion Neko develops trust, forms memories, gets sad when you're gone, and builds a world around your habits — one that wilts if you stop showing up.*

## ✿ What This Is

A **single-page React PWA** designed as a behavioral habit tracker disguised as a kawaii companion experience. Everything runs client-side with `localStorage` — no backend, no accounts, no data leaves your device.

The core loop: **complete habits → Neko trusts you more → the world grows → new things unlock → you want to come back.**

<br>

## 🌍 Live Demo

**→ [kawaii-habit-tracker.vercel.app](https://kawaii-habit-tracker.vercel.app)**

Open on mobile for the best experience. Install it to your home screen — it runs fullscreen like a native app.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Framework** | React 19 (functional components, hooks, refs) |
| **Build Tool** | Vite 8 (HMR, fast refresh) |
| **PWA** | Service worker + Web App Manifest (installable, offline-capable) |
| **Styling** | CSS-in-JSX — scoped `<style>` block with `:root` design tokens |
| **Typography** | Google Fonts — Quicksand (headings), Nunito (body) |
| **Icons** | Native emoji system + custom SVG sprites |
| **Storage** | `localStorage` — 13 keys for all state persistence |
| **State** | `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback` |
| **Animations** | CSS transitions, cubic-bezier curves, confetti particles |
| **Deploy** | Vercel (auto-deploy on push) |
| **Linting** | ESLint 9 with React Hooks plugin |

<br>

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Hyper-kawaii aesthetic.** Pastel pinks, soft peach tones, rounded corners everywhere.
- **Mobile-first.** Designed at 412px viewport. Scales gracefully with `max-width: 430px` container.
- **Glass-card UI.** Layered cards with pink-toned shadows and hover lift effects.
- **Emotionally designed.** UI elements respond to Neko's mood — subtle shifts you feel but don't consciously notice.
- **Zero dependencies for UI.** No component library — every button, card, modal, and animation is handcrafted.

## 📱 Install as App

This is a **Progressive Web App**. On mobile:

1. Open [kawaii-habit-tracker.vercel.app](https://kawaii-habit-tracker.vercel.app) in Chrome

## 🎭 How Neko Works

Neko isn't a chatbot — it's a **behavioral companion** with persistent emotional state.

| Mechanic | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Trust** | Increases when you complete habits. Guarded on first load so it doesn't spike. |
| **Sadness** | Increases when you're absent. Capped so it never feels cruel. |
| **Memories** | Stored in localStorage. Neko recalls them as emotional dialogue (~30% chance). |
| **Dialogue State** | Tracked via `useRef` — rotation index, last message type, cooldowns. |
| **Relationship Level** | Derived from trust with friction — doesn't jump instantly on a good day. |
| **Personality** | Persists across sessions. Neko remembers who you are and how you've been. |

<br>

## 💾 Data Persistence

All data lives in `localStorage` under the `kw_` prefix:

| Key | What It Stores |
|---|---|
| `kw_habits` | Habit definitions + completion history |
| `kw_todos` | To-do items |
| `kw_challenges` | Challenge progress |
| `kw_nekoName` | The name you gave your Neko |
| `kw_lastActive` | Last session timestamp |
| `kw_personality` | Trust, sadness, relationship values |
| `kw_milestones` | Achievement unlocks |
| `kw_worldName` | What you named your world |
| `kw_memories` | Neko's formed memories (rarity-tiered) |
| `kw_onboarded` | Whether onboarding has been completed |
| `kw_nekoMemory` | Persistent Neko memory state |
| `kw_openHours` | Hour-of-day usage tracking for routine detection |
| `kw_lastReward` | Timestamp of last major reveal (6h spacing) |
